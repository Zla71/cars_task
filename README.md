# Classic cars pipeline

This is a small pipeline which opens a JSON file and creates a pandas DataFrame.
    After those steps the pipeline makes a few tasks:
    1. Prints the number of unique cars in the dataset.
    2. Prints the average horse power of all the cars.
    3. Prints the top 5 most heaviest cars.
    4. Prints the number of cars made by each manufacturer.
    5. Prints the number of cars made each year.
    6. Saves the dataset to a CSV file.
    For all these tasks are used some pandas methods and functions, OOP programming, logging, error handling and docstrings
