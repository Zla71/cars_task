# Classic cars pipeline

This is a small pipeline which opens a JSON file and creates a pandas DataFrame.
    After those steps the pipeline makes a few tasks:
    <br/>1. Prints the number of unique cars in the dataset.
    <br/>2. Prints the average horse power of all the cars.
    <br/>3. Prints the top 5 most heaviest cars.
    <br/>4. Prints the number of cars made by each manufacturer.
    <br/>5. Prints the number of cars made each year.
    <br/>6. Saves the dataset to a CSV file.
    <br/>For all these tasks are used some pandas methods and functions, OOP programming, logging, error handling and docstrings
